## OFF Paradigm Project

This repository contains a Matlab implementation of Westheimer Paradigm.  

Function *westheimer.m* will generate an square image frame matrix and image sequence vector (frame presentation order) to be used with xDiva Matlab file paradigm. Optionally the image matrix can be viewed with Matlab's movie generation functions (must specify update frequencies) or *flipBook.m* written by Eeero Simoncelli's lab (http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/MTmodel/).  

Paradigm parameters, such as the number of squares, luminances and update frequencies are described in *WestheimerOutput.mat*.  

Base element (three squares with different luminance values placed on top of each other) is generated by *makeSquareElement.m*. 

The xDiva matlab function paradigm is implemented in *pmf_Westheimer.m*.
